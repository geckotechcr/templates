All dimming and on/off functionality is controlled by an MCU that does not follow the Tuya protocol.  Dimming and on/off can be set by Tasmota using simple serial commands.  Reading local dimming when set by the capacitive touch panel requires a Script-enabled build and the script below to process serial status codes sent by the dimmer MCU.

To use the script, you have to compile Tasmota with [Scripting](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Scripting-Language) enabled. A precompiled binary from development branch is availiable [here](https://github.com/tasmota/binaries).

Status codes take the form of 24xx012123, with xx ranging from 01 to 64 (hex 1-100).

Minimum dimming level may vary by light fixture - adjust the ‘off’ value to match your setup in the >D section.

```lua
>D 100
rng=235
dimh=""
slider=0
power=0
dimval=1
a=""
b=""
c=""
d=0
f=0
;set the hex code below to the largest value possible that will turn off the relay with SerialSend5
off=0x7f

>B

rng-=off

>E
slider=Dimmer
if chg[slider]>0
then
; dim according slider
if slider>0 and dimval!=slider
then
dimval=slider

if sl(a)>0
then
;process the first and second hex nibbles
b=sb(a -8 1)
c=sb(a -7 1) 
a=""
;convert the first nibble to decimal – max value is 0x60
